# Thyroid-Disease-Detection
Thyroid disease a very common problem in India, more than one crore people are suffering with the disease every year. Thyroid disorder can speed up or slow down the metabolism of the body.

The main objective of this project is to predict if a person is having 'compensated_hypothyroid', 'negative' (no thyroid), 'primary_hypothyroid', 'secondary_hypothyroid'  with the help of Machine Learning. Classification algorithms such as XG Boost, Random Forest, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors have been trained on the thyroid dataset, UCI Machine Learning repository. Random Forest performed well with better accuracy (99.16%), precision and recall. ExtraTreesClassifier algorithm is used for feature selection and feature importance.
